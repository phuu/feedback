# phuu/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It's inspired by 
[@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and forked from [@mdo's](https://github.com/mdo/feedback).

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/phuu/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@phuunet](https://twitter.com/phuunet) on
Twitter.
